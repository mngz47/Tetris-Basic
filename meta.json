  "description":"Tetris begins with an empty screen, and requires the player to fit falling blocks together like a puzzle. There are seven shapes composed of four blocks each, and they fall into the space one at a time at a fixed speed. The player's goal is to rotate the shapes as they fall to complete solid rows without gaps.",
